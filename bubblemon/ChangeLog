    bottom of the "water" are drawn outside of 56x56 region.

Fri 16 Mar 2001 - 1.3
    Fixed load average graph - I don't know what the hell I was doing that
    it worked before, but the way the code was written it was never supposed
    to work :)
    Added some contributed code to hopefully catch most of bubble-related
    segfaults.  Thanks to "John H. Robinson, IV" <jaqque@ucsd.edu>
    Updated Makefile to use proper libs when linking with gdk, etc.  Should
    stop complaints about "missing library dependencies"
    This is a recommented upgrade if you use bubblemon version 1.2 or newer.
    Released version 1.3

Sat 14 Apr 2001 - 1.31
    FreeBSD machines were compiling bubblemon as "big-endian", resulting in
    fairly weird looking color problem.  This has been fixed :)  Minor change
    to Makefile.FreeBSD to put bubblemon in /usr/X11R6 during install.
    Released version 1.31
    
Mon 16 Apr 2001 - 1.32
    Important security update for FreeBSD - previous versions did not drop
    kmem privileges, and programs started by clicking on the dockapp were
    started with elevated privileges.  This is a required upgrade for FreeBSD
    users.

Tue 28 Aug 2001 - 1.4
