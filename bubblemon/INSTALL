Install instructions:

1. read README
1a. On Linux 2.6, edit Makefile and uncommend top line that adds -DKERNEL_26
2. make (on FreeBSD, make -f Makefile.FreeBSD)
3. make install (this will put bubblemon in /usr/local/bin)
4. bubblemon &

Using GNU make bubblemon should compile without changes on any system listed
in SUPPORTED_SYSTEMS file.  If not, feel free to fix it and send me a diff -u.

Check README file for configuration options - you can either permanently
disable a feature by editing Makefile and commenting out any of the EXTRA
defines, or disable it at run-time by using command-line switches. Colors
and bubble physics can also be configured through ~/.Xdefaults file.

If your FreeBSD system doesn't have GNU Make, use Makefile.FreeBSD. If it
does, regular Makefile should be able to detect things correctly. Also,
on FreeBSD, you can do make install as root to install in /usr/local/bin
and give bubblemon proper permissions, or you'll have to give bubblemon
kmem access yourself:
root:~# chown root:kmem bubblemon; chmod g+s bubblemon
