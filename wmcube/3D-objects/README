The object-files to be used with wmcube has the
following format:

WMCUBE_COORDINATES

1   50  -40   30
2  -50   50  -30
3  -20   70  -20
^   ^    ^    ^
|   |    |    \__ Z-coordinate relative the center
|   |     \______ Y-coordinate relative the center
|    \___________ X-coordinate relative the center
 \_______________ Coordinate index


The indexes must be 1,2,3...n on a object with n coordinates.
The center of the object is the coordinate the object will
revolve around (0,0,0);

The next section is either (case sensitive):

* WMCUBE_LINES

1 2
2 3
3 1

These are the coordinates wmcube will draw lines
between.

or

* WMCUBE_PLANES

1 2 3
2 3 1
1 3 2
2 1 3

These are the coordinates wmcube will use as corner-
coordinates for a plane. The tricky part is that the
plane will be drawn only if you list the coordinates
making up the plane in clockwise order. In the example
above, the first two rows making up planes with coordinates
1 2 3 and 2 3 1 will NOT be drawn until the object
has rotated some X degrees but the other two will be
drawn at once. Its kinda hard to explain, just try and you
will eventually understand how it works.


Done! Save the file with a .wmc suffix (preferably) and try
running wmcube with the -o option and it will tell you if
something is wrong with the object. Otherwise enjoy and
remember to send me all the cool objects you create :-)
