Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Linux (glibc at least 2.1) tested on various distributions
  or Solaris 8 Sparc/x86 (should work on Solaris 2.x and 7),
  or OpenBSD,
  or FreeBSD 3-stable, 4-stable,
  or NetBSD

- root access

  To be able to install the application system-wide you need
  the root access.

Disclaimer
--------------------------------------------------------------
I tested the current version of wmcube just on Linux.  The
Makefiles for FreeBSD, NetBDS, OpenBSD, and Solaris were
prepared in 2000 by different contributors and I can not
guarantee that they still work as they should.  So customizing
them to your needs is up to you.

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1)  $ tar -zxf wmcube-1.0.2.tar.gz

2)  $ cd wmcube-1.0.2/wmcube

3)  $ make                    # if you run Linux
    or:
    $ make -f Makefile.XXX    # for XXX OS running

Optional:

4)  $ su -

5)  # make install

6)  # exit
